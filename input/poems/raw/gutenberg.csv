the winds in the sky.",gutenberg

side they were white-washed thick, To keep out every spark of the sun.",gutenberg

walked all the way Blaspheming
at the path he trod.",gutenberg

the names he knew of God.",gutenberg

had curdled in his breast.",gutenberg

and his love had thrown him over For the
chinking money-bags she liked best.",gutenberg

his grain-bin, The deer had trampled on his corn, His brook had shrivelled in
a summer drought, And his sheep had died unshorn.",gutenberg

his cow broke loose, And his old horse perished
of a colic.",gutenberg

nibbled into holes By little,
glutton mice on a frolic.",gutenberg

all he ever had, And the blood
in his body dried.",gutenberg

still lived on, And cursed that future
which had lied.",gutenberg

delved, with care and pain, And the veins in
his forehead stood taut.",gutenberg

when every bone cracked, He
gathered up what he had sought.",gutenberg

crusted glass, Prismed while it
lay buried deep.",gutenberg
"Shifting reds and greens, like
a pigeon's neck, At the touch of
the sun began to leap.",gutenberg

Flashing like an opal-stone, Carved into a flagon; and the colours
glanced and ran, Where at first there had seemed to be none.",gutenberg
"It had handles on
each side to bear it up, And a belly
for the gurgling wine.",gutenberg
"Its neck was slender,
and its mouth was wide, And its
lip was curled and fine.",gutenberg
"Then he carried it home, and
put it on a shelf, But it was
only grey in the gloom.",gutenberg
"So he fetched a pail,
and a bit of cloth, And he
went outside with a broom.",gutenberg
"The old man forgot to swear,
Watching its shadow grown a mammoth
size, Dancing in the kitchen there.",gutenberg
"He forgot to revile
the sun next morning When he found his
vase afire in its light.",gutenberg

of the house that day, And kept it
close beside him until night.",gutenberg

happened from day
to day.",gutenberg

life On the beauty of his vase,
on its perfect shape.",gutenberg

forgot its former
strife.",gutenberg

was dug from the ground.",gutenberg

thought of an oath, in his joy At
showing what he had found.",gutenberg

school Passed him as he stooped at toil, Hoeing for a bean-row, and at
his side Was the vase, on the turned-up soil.",gutenberg

round with him everywhere, As
it gave him joy to do.",gutenberg

into glass, And the vase fell to
iridescent sherds.",gutenberg

dry sobs.",gutenberg

in the very place Whence the
beautiful vase had been borne.",gutenberg

patted it down, Then he hobbled to
his house and shut the door.",gutenberg

nailed it at the windows That no
beam of light should cross the floor.",gutenberg

of the empty hearth, And he
neither ate nor drank.",gutenberg
